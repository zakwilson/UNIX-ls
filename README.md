# Guidelines
This month's project is to replicate the functionality of UNIX's ls command. This is a tool that everyone should be familiar with. The purpose of the project is to exercise the ability to write a program in the functional language of your choice and interact with command-line input, control structures, iteration, file system interaction, output, error handling in that language. 

Expectations:
* List files, sizes, etc. in current directory
* List files, sizes, etc. in directory specified as argument
* Display error messages and help if needed
* Write tests
